# Web App Dashboard Exercise

Use the provided mockups, SVG files and member images to build a web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. This exercise only needs to create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for a one page dashboard so does not build any backend or database functionality.
